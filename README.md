# Unifying_subiculum

The following contains all the code required to recreate the figures for the paper: Unifying the Subiculum: A Predictive Map Approach (2024).

## Requirements
The code requires Python3 and Pip to install relevant packages.


## Procedure
The 'Making_successor_features.ipynb' allows you to regenerate the three populations of biologically plausible basis features, uniform basis features and successor features we use to match the three experimental environments, using a single example of a rodent trajectory from Muessig et al. (2024).

The 'Main_figures.ipynb' allows you to recreate Figures 3,4 and 5 of the main text, and Supplementary Figure 6.
